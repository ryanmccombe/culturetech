This is a public safety announcement… Please keep your head firmly on your shoulders and your arms, legs and feet firmly inside the ride at all times – Ministry of Science Live is about to explode onto a stage near you soon! Ministry of Science Live is not your ordinary science show – it comes with a bang. It comes with a whoosh. But most of all it comes with a Hovercraft built on stage.\n\nFrom liquid nitrogen frozen flowers to hydrogen bottle rockets fired right at you the show will take you on a journey using demonstrations and a few loud bangs to lead the way. From the creative team behind Brainiac Live, Guinness World Records Officially Amazing Science Live and a whole load of other educational shows with an anarchic twist – Ministry of Science Live is not to be missed….\n\nMinistry of Science is supported by Seagate and ILEX",
